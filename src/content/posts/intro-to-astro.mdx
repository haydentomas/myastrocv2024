## I am not gonna lie, Astro isn't easy to learn!

I am a developer whi has been working with WordPress for the past 5 years. I love WordPress, but I wanted to try something new. Astro.js was the perfect choice for me. It forces me to learn TypeScript and JavaScript, which I have been avoiding for a long time.

I have been creating most websites using a couple of different page builders. Oxygen and Bricks. I have no issue with them at all. They are great tools. They speed up development time and make it easy to create complex websites. However I have always struggled security, updates, maintenance, plugins... the list goes on.

I created a staic site a while back using a static site generator called Hugo. It was a great experience. I wanted to try gatsby, however it's JavaScript focused and I felt that it was a bit of a sledgehammer/nut situation!

## Why i chose Astro

I chose Astro because it's a modern web framework that aims to make building fast, efficient websites easier than ever. It combines the best aspects of static site generation with the dynamic capabilities of traditional server-rendered applications. So basically that means you can do things that a static website has no business doing, whihc is awesome. 

Static sites these days are capable of search, tagging, comments, forms, and more. For me, all I wanted was a couple of content collections, a contact form and some simple SEO. I didnt see why I had to battle with WordPress and its security issues to achieve website nirvana!

## How to get started with Astro

Grab yourself a copy of Visual Studio code, its teh best took for the job. It has a built in terminal and has a shed load of extensions that will help you with your development.

Once you have downloaded that bad boy, open up the terminal and start a project.

`npm create astro@latest` 

Once installed, create a new Astro.js project:

```
create-astro my-astro-project
cd my-astro-project
npm install
npm run dev
```

Now you have a basic Astro.js project up and running. You can start building your website using Astro.js's component-based approach and enjoy the benefits of a lightning-fast website.
